# Fixed context overhead

`tokenatlas overhead [--refresh] [--harness H] [--since ISO] [--json]` shows how much fixed context a
session carries: the system prompt, tool lists, instruction files (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md), the skills list, MCP
instructions, and skill bodies when a skill is used. `--refresh` rescans the default session roots first.

## What is exact and what is estimated

| Harness | Exact | Estimated / unavailable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Character counts of `attachment` rows (skill listing, each instruction file, nested memory, MCP instructions, deferred tools, agent listing, system prompt snapshot, session context); skill body size from the `isMeta` row that follows a `Skill` tool use; floor tokens from the first assistant row (`input + cache_creation + cache_read`) | Tokens of components (4 characters per token) |
| Codex | System prompt (`base_instructions`), `<skills_instructions>`, `<INSTRUCTIONS>` and `<environment_context>` blocks (tags included, each block separately); floor from the first `token_count` `last_token_usage.input_tokens` | Skill reads are `heuristic`: an `exec` call that mentions a path ending in `SKILL.md`, sized by its output |
| Pi | Floor only, from the first assistant message with nonzero usage (`input + cacheRead + cacheWrite`) | Components unavailable |
| OpenCode | Skill output size (`skill` tool parts); floor from the first assistant message tokens (`input + cache.read + cache.write`) | Components unavailable |

The floor is the whole first request, so it also contains tools, the first user prompt and anything the
harness does not log. The report shows `other: tools, first prompt, unlogged` as floor minus the estimated
component tokens (median over sessions that log components). It is an estimate, not a measurement.

## Recurring cost

The floor is re-read on every call after the first, so the estimate is `floor x (calls - 1) x cache_read price`,
labelled `API-equivalent at list price, estimate`. The price comes from the session's dominant model in the
history database (`usage.pricing`, priced per call so long-context tiers use the per-call size); a session with
no history records, or an unpriced model, contributes no cost and is counted as unpriced. Subagent sessions use
their parent's dominant model. `calls` counts distinct priced requests: Claude `requestId` (else message id),
Codex distinct cumulative token totals, Pi `responseId` (else entry id), OpenCode assistant messages with tokens.
This absolute total depends on usage (`recurring re-read cost (total, depends on usage)`). Cache writes on the first call are not included, and a cache miss or expiry mid-session would raise the real bill.

## Relative, usage-normalized comparison

Totals such as the recurring cost mostly reflect how much a harness was used, so the report opens with a
comparison table (one row per harness, sorted by `fixed % of input` ascending, most efficient first). Token
counts come from each provider's own tokenizer (Claude 4.7+ counts about 30% more tokens for the same text), so
compare the percentages across providers, not raw tokens. Each session's history records are joined on
`(harness, session)`; per session `input_total = fresh_input + cache_write + cache_read`, `output_total`, and
`cost_total` (API-equivalent, `usage.pricing`). `fixed_tokens_session = floor_tokens x calls`, capped at
`input_total`.

| Measure | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `floor/call` | Median floor tokens, with p10 and p90 |
| `fixed % of input` | sum(fixed_tokens_session) / sum(input_total); also the per-session median |
| `fixed per 1k output` | sum(fixed_tokens_session) / sum(output_total) x 1000; `*` when any session has `output_not_final` observations (output is then a lower bound, so the ratio is an upper bound) |
| `fixed % of cost` | sum(recurring re-read cost) / sum(cost_total) over sessions with both known |
| `calls/session` | Median and p90 of `calls` |
| `n` | Sessions used for the input / output / cost measures |

Sessions are excluded per measure, with counts by reason under `relative.excluded` in `--json` and in a text
footnote: `no_floor`, `no_history_records`, `tokens_unknown` (a token class missing), `cost_unknown` (cost measure
only), and `subagent_unmatched`. Claude subagent sessions join to the subagent's own history rows by parent
session and the agent id from the transcript file name (`agent-<id>.jsonl`, since the rows' `agent` field holds the
agent type); the main session's totals exclude those rows, and unmatched ones are excluded and reported.

## The 4 characters per token estimate

Component tokens are `characters / 4`. That is a rough English-prose figure; code, JSON, non-English text and
tokenizers differ (often 2.5 to 3.5 characters per token for code), so treat token figures as order of magnitude.
Character counts and floor tokens are the only measured values.

## Privacy

Stored in the history database (tables `overhead_sessions`, `overhead_items`, `overhead_skill_uses`): sizes in
characters, component and skill names, counts, session ids, timestamps and token counts. Never content, prompts,
tool inputs or arguments. Instruction-file and nested-memory paths are stored only as `basename#hash` where the
hash is the first 10 hex digits of SHA-256 of the full path. Rescanning is rescan-all with an upsert per
harness and session, so repeated runs are idempotent; sessions that later disappear from disk are retained.
